          <p>
            By subscribing to these terms, the Investment partner represents
            that he/she is interested in investing in THE BLISSVILLE TERRACES
            PROJECT and will advance an investment sum to be paid in a single
            deposit or any other format (to be agreed upon in writing) in
            Highrachy&apos;s account as detailed below:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <strong>Account Name:</strong> Highrachy Investment & Technology
              Limited
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Account Number:</strong> 0029082860

        <li>
          <h6>2. INVESTMENT STRUCTURE</h6>
          <p>
            <strong>2.1 </strong>The investment partner shall provide capital to
            fund the development project as per the agreed investment amount and
            terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.2 </strong>The investment shall be considered as equity
            funding, and Highrachy shall utilize the funds as deemed
            appropriate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>3. RETURNS AND GUARANTEES</h6>
          <p>
            <strong>3.1 </strong> Highrachy estimates an eighteen (18) months
            window for the return on investment (ROI) realization in line with
            the project cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.2 </strong> Investment partners have a potential return on
            investment (ROI) of up to 50% in 18 months (i.e., 33% p.a.).
            Nonetheless, it is recognized that this ROI is contingent upon the
            performance of the property development project and may therefore
            fluctuate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.3 </strong> The investment sum will accrue interest on
            principal sum based on the project&apos;s financial performance at
            the expiration of the tenure. Interest payment is subject to
            withholding tax.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.4 </strong> Subject to availability of unsold units and
            subject to the approval of Highrachy, the investment partner may at
            the expiration of the tenure before repayment be entitled to apply
            to convert his/her investment to one or more unit(s) of flat
            commensurate with the sum to which the investment partner is
            entitled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.5 </strong> Upon the exercise of the option set out in
            Clause 3.4 above, the investment partner&apos;s expected returns may
            be exchanged for apartment unit(s) at the current Blissville unit
            cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3.6 </strong> The investment amount shall be guaranteed by
            property within the estate giving the investment partner the option
            to convert his investment plus accrued returns to property ownership
            by paying the balance in line with the property value.
          </p>
        </li>

            accepting these Terms (subject to deposit of investment sum) and
            Condition and/or upon full discharge of investment partner&apos;s

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4.2 </strong>Where the investment partner wishes to
            terminate his/her investment before the expiration of the duration
            for the project, the investment partner will notify Highrachy in
            writing to which Highrachy will reply within 7 working days and in
            writing inform the investment partner of the repayment plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4.3 </strong>The investment partner has the option to
            reinvest the proceeds of the investment in subsequent funding
            endeavors as will be advised by Highrachy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4.4 </strong>In the event of early redemption (premature
            termination) that is initiated by the investment partner, the
            interest payable shall be determined as follows:
          </p>

            <strong>4.4.3 </strong> Between 13-18 months - the capital plus
            prevailing FG bond rates will apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4.5 </strong> Upon early redemption, the repayment to the
            investment partner shall be processed solely from the proceeds of
            property sales.
